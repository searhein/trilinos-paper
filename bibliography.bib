  abstract = {The parallel performance of the three-level fast and robust overlapping Schwarz (FROSch) preconditioners is investigated for linear elasticity. The FROSch framework is part of the Trilinos software library and contains a parallel implementation of different preconditioners with energy minimizing coarse spaces of generalized Dryja--Smith--Widlund type. The three-level extension is constructed by a recursive application of the FROSch preconditioner to the coarse problem. In this paper, the additional steps in the implementation in order to apply the FROSch preconditioner recursively are described in detail. Furthermore, it is shown that no explicit geometric information is needed in the recursive application of the preconditioner. In particular, the rigid body modes, including the rotations, can be interpolated on the coarse level without additional geometric information. Parallel results for a three-dimensional linear elasticity problem obtained on the Theta supercomputer (Argonne Leadership Computing Facility, Argonne, IL) using up to 220 000 cores are discussed and compared to results obtained on the SuperMUC-NG supercomputer (Leibniz Supercomputing Centre, Garching, Germany). Notably, it can be observed that a hierarchical communication operation in FROSch related to the coarse operator starts to dominate the computing time on Theta, which has a dragonfly interconnect, for 100 000 message passing interface (MPI) ranks or more. The same operation, however, scales well and stays within the order of a second in all experiments performed on SuperMUC-NG, which uses a fat tree network. Using hybrid MPI/OpenMP parallelization, the onset of the MPI communication problem on Theta can be delayed. Further analysis of the performance of FROSch on large supercomputers with dragonfly interconnects will be necessary.},

	abstract = {The generalized Dryja–Smith–Widlund (GDSW) preconditioner is a two-level overlapping Schwarz domain decomposition (DD) preconditioner that couples a classical one-level overlapping Schwarz preconditioner with an energy-minimizing coarse space. When used to accelerate the convergence rate of Krylov subspace iterative methods, the GDSW preconditioner provides robustness and scalability for the solution of sparse linear systems arising from the discretization of a wide range of partial different equations. In this paper, we present FROSch (Fast and Robust Schwarz), a domain decomposition solver package which implements GDSW-type preconditioners for both CPU and GPU clusters. To improve the solver performance on GPUs, we use a novel decomposition to run multiple MPI processes on each GPU, reducing both solver’s computational and storage costs and potentially improving the convergence rate. This allowed us to obtain competitive or faster performance using GPUs compared to using CPUs alone. We demonstrate the performance of FROSch on the Summit supercomputer with NVIDIA V100 GPUs, where we used NVIDIA Multi-Process Service (MPS) to implement our decomposition strategy.The solver has a wide variety of algorithmic and implementation choices, which poses both opportunities and challenges for its GPU implementation. We conduct a thorough experimental study with different solver options including the exact or inexact solution of the local overlapping subdomain problems on a GPU. We also discuss the effect of using the iterative variant of the incomplete LU factorization and sparse-triangular solve as the approximate local solver, and using lower precision for computing the whole FROSch preconditioner. Overall, the solve time was reduced by factors of about 2× using GPUs, while the GPU acceleration of the numerical setup time depend on the solver options and the local matrix sizes.},

abstract = {The variational multiscale (VMS) formulation is used to develop residual-based VMS large eddy simulation (LES) models for Rayleigh-Bénard convection. The resulting model is a mixed model that incorporates the VMS model and an eddy viscosity model. The Wall-Adapting Local Eddy-viscosity (WALE) model is used as the eddy viscosity model in this work. The new LES models were implemented in the finite element code Drekar. Simulations are performed using continuous, piecewise linear finite elements. The simulations ranged from Ra=106 to Ra=1014 and were conducted at Pr=1 and Pr=7. Two domains were considered: a two-dimensional domain of aspect ratio 2 with a fluid confined between two parallel plates and a three-dimensional cylinder of aspect ratio 1/4. The Nusselt number from the VMS results is compared against three dimensional direct numerical simulations and experiments. In all cases, the VMS results are in good agreement with existing literature.}

abstract = {A critical aspect of applying modern computational solution methods to complex multiphysics systems of relevance to nuclear reactor modeling, is the assessment of the predictive capability of specific proposed mathematical models. In this respect the understanding of numerical error, the sensitivity of the solution to parameters associated with input data, boundary condition uncertainty, and mathematical models is critical. Additionally, the ability to evaluate and or approximate the model efficiently, to allow development of a reasonable level of statistical diagnostics of the mathematical model and the physical system, is of central importance. In this study we report on initial efforts to apply integrated adjoint-based computational analysis and automatic differentiation tools to begin to address these issues. The study is carried out in the context of a Reynolds averaged Navier–Stokes approximation to turbulent fluid flow and heat transfer using a particular spatial discretization based on implicit fully-coupled stabilized FE methods. Initial results are presented that show the promise of these computational techniques in the context of nuclear reactor relevant prototype thermal-hydraulics problems.}

abstract = "The computational solution of the governing balance equations for mass, momentum, heat transfer and magnetic induction for resistive magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) systems can be extremely challenging. These difficulties arise from both the strong nonlinear, nonsymmetric coupling of fluid and electromagnetic phenomena, as well as the significant range of time- and length-scales that the interactions of these physical mechanisms produce. This paper explores the development of a scalable, fully-implicit stabilized unstructured finite element (FE) capability for 3D incompressible resistive MHD. The discussion considers the development of a stabilized FE formulation in context of the variational multiscale (VMS) method, and describes the scalable implicit time integration and direct-to-steady-state solution capability. The nonlinear solver strategy employs Newton–Krylov methods, which are preconditioned using fully-coupled algebraic multilevel preconditioners. These preconditioners are shown to enable a robust, scalable and efficient solution approach for the large-scale sparse linear systems generated by the Newton linearization. Verification results demonstrate the expected order-of-accuracy for the stabilized FE discretization. The approach is tested on a variety of prototype problems, that include MHD duct flows, an unstable hydromagnetic Kelvin–Helmholtz shear layer, and a 3D island coalescence problem used to model magnetic reconnection. Initial results that explore the scaling of the solution methods are also presented on up to 128K processors for problems with up to 1.8B unknowns on a CrayXK7."

abstract = {This study considers an implicit finite element formulation for an ideal fully-ionized multifluid electromagnetic plasma system. The formulation is based on fully-implicit Runge-Kutta time discretizations and a monolithic discrete algebraic flux corrected (AFC) continuous Galerkin (CG) spatial discretization of the coupled system. The AFC approach adds scalar artificial diffusion to the high-order, semi-discrete Galerkin method and uses mass lumping in the time derivative term. The result is a low-order method that attempts to enforce local-extremum-diminishing properties for the hyperbolic system. An element-based iterative limiter is applied to reduce the amount of artificial diffusion that is used in regions where the solution is smooth and the additional stabilization is not required. Two models are considered for the electromagnetics portion of the system: an electrostatic model, and a full Maxwell system with a parabolic divergence cleaning approach that enforces the required involutions on the electric and magnetic fields. Results are presented that demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of the formulation for smooth and discontinuous solutions to challenging plasma physics problems. This includes a demonstration that the solution of the full multifluid system yields the expected behavior in the ideal shock-MHD limit.}

abstract = {Multi-fluid plasma models, where an electron fluid is modeled in addition to multiple ion and neutral species as well as the full set of Maxwell's equations, are useful for representing physics beyond the scope of classic MHD. This advantage presents challenges in appropriately dealing with electron dynamics and electromagnetic behavior characterized by the plasma and cyclotron frequencies and the speed of light. For physical systems, such as those near the MHD asymptotic regime, this requirement drastically increases runtimes for explicit time integration even though resolving fast dynamics may not be critical for accuracy. Implicit time integration methods, with efficient solvers, can help to step over fast time-scales that constrain stability, but do not strongly influence accuracy. As an extension, Implicit-explicit (IMEX) schemes provide an additional mechanism to choose which dynamics are evolved using an expensive implicit solve or resolved using a fast explicit solve. In this study, in addition to IMEX methods we also consider a physics compatible exact sequence spatial discretization. This combines nodal bases (H-Grad) for fluid dynamics with a set of vector bases (H-Curl and H-Div) for Maxwell's equations. This discretization allows for multi-fluid plasma modeling without violating Gauss' laws for the electric and magnetic fields. This initial study presents a discussion of the major elements of this formulation and focuses on demonstrating accuracy in the linear wave regime and in the MHD limit for both a visco-resistive and a dispersive ideal MHD problem.}

abstract="Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) is an important and emerging topic in electronic design automation (EDA), as parametric uncertainties are a significant concern for the design of integrated circuits. Historically, various sampling methods such as Monte Carlo (MC) and Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) have been employed, but these methods can be prohibitively expensive. Polynomial Chaos Expansion (PCE) methods are often proposed as an alternative to sampling. PCE methods have a number of variations, representing tradeoffs. Regression-based PCE methods, for example, can be applied to existing sample sets and don't require specific quadrature points. However, this comes at the cost of accuracy. In this paper we explore the idea of enhancing regression-based PCE methods using gradient information. The gradient information is provided by an intrusive adjoint sensitivity algorithm embedded in the circuit simulator.",

It provides tools for implementing stochastic Galerkin methodsStochastic Galerkin methodsand embedded sample propagation through the use of template-based generic programming (Pawlowski et al., Sci Program 20:197--219, 2012; Roger et al., Sci Program 20:327--345, 2012) which allows deterministic simulation codes to be easily modified for embedded uncertainty quantification. It provides tools for forming and solving the resulting linear and nonlinear equations these methods generate, leveraging the large-scale linear and nonlinear solver capabilities provided by Trilinos. Furthermore, Stokhos is integrated with the emerging many-core architecture capabilities provided by the Kokkos (Edwards et al., Sci Program 20(2):89--114, 2012; Edwards et al., J Parallel Distrib Comput 74(12):3202--3216, 2014) and Tpetra packages (Baker and Heroux, Sci Program 20(2):115--128, 2012; Hoemmen et al., Tpetra: next-generation distributed linear algebra. http://trilinos.org/packages/tpetra, 2015) within Trilinos, allowing these embedded uncertainty quantification capabilities to be applied in both shared and distributed memory parallel computational environments. Finally, the Stokhos tools have been incorporated into the Albany simulation code (Pawlowski et al., Sci Program 20:327--345, 2012; Salinger et al., Albany multiphysics simulation code. https://github.com/gahansen/Albany, 2015) enabling embedded uncertainty quantification of a wide variety of large-scale PDE-based simulations.},

abstract = {Multiphysics simulation software is plagued by complexity stemming from nonlinearly coupled systems of Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). Such software typically supports many models, which may require different transport equations, constitutive laws, and equations of state. Strong coupling and a multiplicity of models leads to complex algorithms (i.e., the properly ordered sequence of steps to assemble a discretized set of coupled PDEs) and rigid software.This work presents a design strategy that shifts focus away from high-level algorithmic concerns to low-level data dependencies. Mathematical expressions are represented as software objects that directly expose data dependencies. The entire system of expressions forms a directed acyclic graph and the high-level assembly algorithm is generated automatically through standard graph algorithms. This approach makes problems with complex dependencies entirely tractable, and removes virtually all logic from the algorithm itself. Changes are highly localized, allowing developers to implement models without detailed understanding of any algorithms (i.e., the overall assembly process). Furthermore, this approach complements existing MPI-based frameworks and can be implemented within them easily.Finally, this approach enables algorithmic parallelization via threads. By exposing dependencies in the algorithm explicitly, thread-based parallelism is implemented through algorithm decomposition, providing a basis for exploiting parallelism independent from domain decomposition approaches.},

A stretch-dependent smooth muscle model by Uhlmann and Balzani is modified to describe the interaction of pharmacological drugs and the inhibition of smooth muscle activation. The coupled deformation-diffusion problem is then solved using the finite element software FEDDLib and overlapping Schwarz preconditioners from the Trilinos package FROSch. These preconditioners include highly scalable parallel GDSW (generalized Dryja–Smith–Widlund) and RGDSW (reduced GDSW) preconditioners. Simulation results show the expected increase in the lumen diameter of an idealized artery due to the drug-induced reduction of smooth muscle contraction, as well as a decrease in the rate of arterial contraction in the presence of calcium channel blockers. Strong and weak parallel scalability of the resulting computational implementation are also analyzed.},

abstract = {This study presents the development and evaluation of a fully-implicit variational multiscale (VMS) stabilized unstructured finite element (FE) formulation for compressible magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) model, at low Mach number regime. The model describes the dynamics of a compressible conducting fluid in the low Mach number limit in the presence of electromagnetic fields and can be used to study aspects of astrophysical phenomena, important science and technology applications, and basic plasma physics phenomena. The specific applications that motivate this study are macroscopic simulations of the longer time-scale stability and disruptions of magnetic confinement fusion (MCF) devices, specifically the ITER tokamak. The discussion considers the development of the VMS FE representation, the structure of the stabilizing terms that deal with significant convective flows, the stabilization of the nearly incompressible response of the fluid flow, and the stabilization of the constraint that enforces the solenoidal involution on the magnetic field. The nonlinear discretized system is solved with scalable preconditioned Newton–Krylov iterative methods, which employs a multiphysics block preconditioning method based on approximate block factorizations and Schur complements. The study presents an evaluation of the VMS method on a 2D cartesian tearing mode instability, and illustrates the scalability of the solvers on MCF relevant problems. A set of results are also presented for longer time-scale stability and disruptions for the ITER tokamak. These include a vertical displacement event (VDE), and a (1,1) internal kink mode. The formulation is demonstrated to be scalable and also reasonably robust with respect to the Lundquist number scaling.}

abstract = {We utilize generalized moving least squares (GMLS) to develop meshfree techniques for discretizing hydrodynamic flow problems on manifolds. We use exterior calculus to formulate incompressible hydrodynamic equations in the Stokesian regime and handle the divergence-free constraints via a generalized vector potential. This provides less coordinate-centric descriptions and enables the development of efficient numerical methods and splitting schemes for the fourth-order governing equations in terms of a system of second-order elliptic operators. Using a Hodge decomposition, we develop methods for manifolds having spherical topology. We show the methods exhibit high-order convergence rates for solving hydrodynamic flows on curved surfaces. The methods also provide general high-order approximations for the metric, curvature, and other geometric quantities of the manifold and associated exterior calculus operators. The approaches also can be utilized to develop high-order solvers for other scalar-valued and vector-valued problems on manifolds.}
